## Managed App Config settings

URL key: URL to display in app or default home page when BROWSER_MODE is enabled.

**MAINTENANCE_MODE** key: Set to “ON” to display static image and provide user a visual that the device is not available.

**BROWSER_MODE** key: Set to “ON” to display browser navigation bar and provide user an interactive method to navigate web sites.

**BROWSER_BAR_NO_EDIT** key: Set to “ON” to disable the ability to edit the URL address bar.  Use with content filter via config profile to lock down device to specific website.

**REMOTE_LOCK** key: Set to “ON” to remotely trigger Autonomous Single App Mode.  Requires supervised device and config profile with ASAM restriction payload.

**PRIVATE_BROWSING** key: Set to “ON” to enable private browsing mode. While in private browsing mode, the app stores web browsing data in non-persistent local data store similar to Safari using Private Browsing mode.

**RESET_TIMER** key: Set integer value (in seconds) to set an automatic timer to clear browser data and return to default home page. Timer will not activate if already at homepage. Timer is disable by default or disabled with value of 0. (New in version 2.2)

**QUERY_URL_STRING**  Advanced option used with REMOTE_LOCK to support automatically unlocking app when a specific URL is presented. Set value to string contained in URL to be unlocked. Supports completed surveys/forms. (new in version 2.3)

**QR_CODE**  key: Set to “ON” to enable QR Code scanning within the web browser. Setting the value to ON will present camera icon. (new in version 2.5)

**LAUNCH_DELAY**  key: Set integer value (in seconds) to set delay before web page in reloaded after failed attempt. Handy for when network is not available and workaround for timing issues with newer device hardware. (new in version 2.5)
